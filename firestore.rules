/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-specific
 * data is isolated under a dedicated path, `/users/{userId}`, ensuring that users can only
 * ever access their own information.
 *
 * Data Structure: The entire data model is hierarchical, starting with the top-level
 * `/users` collection. Each document within this collection represents a single user and
 * serves as the root for all of that user's data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is completely private. A user can read, write, and delete their own
 *   user profile document, but cannot access anyone else's.
 * - Listing all users is explicitly disallowed to protect user privacy and prevent
 *   data enumeration attacks.
 * - The default security posture is to deny all access unless an explicit rule
 *   grants it to the document owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: Authorization is based on the path parameter `{userId}`.
 * To ensure data integrity, the `id` field within a user's document must match the
 * document's ID (`userId`) upon creation and cannot be changed thereafter. This avoids
 * extra reads and keeps the authorization logic simple and performant.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: This model does not contain public or shared data, so all
 * collections are private and secured using the same ownership pattern.
