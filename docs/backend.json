    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure prioritizes user-specific data isolation and authorization independence. User profiles and their associated data are stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring that each user's data is separate and only accessible to them. The `users/{userId}/crackerData` subcollection stores the pollution data and cracker budget information. This design eliminates the need for complex `get()` calls in security rules, as all authorization is based on the user's `uid` and path-based ownership. The `roles_admin/{uid}` collection is used to assign admin roles, which can be checked using document existence in security rules. This structure supports QAPs by enabling secure `list` operations within each user's data and by segregating admin role management into a dedicated collection. The denormalization strategy involves storing all relevant user data within their specific path, avoiding dependencies on parent documents for authorization."
